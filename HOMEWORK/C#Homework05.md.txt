1. What is a compound assignment operator? How does it work?
- The compound assignment operators consist of a binary operator and the simple assignment operator. They perform the operation of the binary operator on both operands and store the result of that operation into the left operand, which must be a modifiable lvalue.
- 

2. List all the compound assignment operators.
- the compound assignment operators are as followed:
*= variable * number
/= variable / number
%= variable % number = %=(remainder)
+= variable + number
-= variable - number

3. List two ways to increment a numeric variable by 5. List two ways to decrement a numeric variable by 50.
variable = +5 or +5 = variable


4. How long does a while loop run?
A while loop will run repeatedly as long as the statement is true and will stop when the Boolean expression evaluates to false.

5. What happens if you donâ€™t change the loop variable in the body of the while loop block?
- 


6. How many parts does a for loop statement have? Can you omit any of them? Can you omit all of them? What happens if you omit all of them?
- The loop consists of three important parts: the initialisation, termination, and the update control.
- Yes you can omit any parts of the for loop. 
- If you omit all the statements 

7. How do you guarantee that a loop runs at least once?
- the loop must be a a while loop because it is not evaluated until the end of the loop
- as long as the statement is true
 
8. What does the break statement do?
- The break statement to jump out of the body of an iteration statement.


9. What does the continue statement do?
- the continue statement causes the program to perform the next iteration of the loop immediately.
-skips what ever is below it and continues to the next step
