1. What is the diﬀerence between deep copy and shallow copy?
- A deep copy copies all fields, and makes copies of dynamically allocated memory pointed to by the fields
is the process of creating a clone of an object by instantiating a new instance of the same type as original object 
Shallow copy- if you change one 

2. What is the value of a reference after you declare and initialize it?
- The value of a reference after you declare it , returns a memory address

3. How do you declare a value type? 
- The computer generates code that allocates a block of memory big enough to hold a corresponding value
state the data type.
int i;

4. How do you declare a reference type?
- variable name = new ()
 cow elsie = new (cow);

5. Does C# allow you to assign NULL to a value type?
- No it does not allow you to assign

6. Can you assign a nullable value type to a non-nullable variable of the same type? Why or why not?
- No, because you dont know if the nullable type contains a value nor the does the machine

7. What is the diﬀerence between the stack and the heap?
-stack is organized and heap is unorganized 

8. What does it mean when we say that all classes are specialized types?
-  

9. What does ref do?
- It allows you to do the parameter you also do to the original argument both referenceand the same data

10. What does out do?
- 

11. Describe boxing and unboxing in your own words.
- boxing 
- unboxing convert a reference type to a value type

12. What does cast do?
- It allows you to specify the data refereced by an object has a specific type and that is safe to reference the object by using that type.
