1.	Declare an enum for military ranks either officer or enlisted. Name it ranks. What are the symbols, like private, PFC, Coroporal, 2LT, 1LT, Capt?
enum Ranks {1LT, 2LT, CPT, MAJ, LTC, COL, BG, MG, LTG}

2.	Using the ranks enum assign a rank to yourself or a friend.
Ranks Wilson = Ranks.MAJ;

3.	Determine the numeric index of particular ranks, using the Ranks enum.
ConsoleWriteLine((int)enum Ranks);

4.	How do you select the type of an enum?
enum Ranks : short {1LT, 2LT, CPT, MAJ, LTC, COL, BG, MG, LTG}

5.	Are structs stored on the stack or the heap? What about enums?
A struct is a value type and thus stored on the stack. An enum is a type as well and thus stored on the stack.

6.	Declare a struct named DOD with 4 branches.
struct DOD { public string Army, AirForce, Navy, Marines; }

7.	Why can't you create a default constructor for a struct?
The reason you cant declare your own default constructor for a structure is that the compiler always generates one. In a class, the compiler generates the default constructor only is you don't write a constructor yourself.

8.	What is CIL? What does the CLR do to the CIL?
CIL is the common intermediate language and it is the language the compiler converts C# code into. The CLR (common language runtime) then converts this to real machine instructions that the processor on your computer can understand and execute.
