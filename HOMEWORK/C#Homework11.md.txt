1. How do you deﬁne a method that takes an arbitrary number of arguments?2
class Util
{
	public static int Min(params int[] paramList

2. How do you call a method that takes an arbitrary number of argiments?
public int dostuff(params int[] stuff
dostuff(1)  			stuff[0] = 1
dostuff(1,2)			stuff[1] == 2
dostuff(1,2,3,4,5,6,	stuff[9] == 123456

3. Why can’t you use an array to pass an arbitrary number of arguments to a method?
- You cannot use and array to pass an arbirtary number becaue a method that takes optional parameters still has a fixed parameter list, and you cannot
pass and arbitrary list of arguments.

4. How many parameters can a method have?
- Generally you can use parameter arrays for methods that take any number of parameters including (none).

5. Do parameter arguments have to have the same type?
yes, all your parameters have to by the same type

6. What is the diﬀerence between a method that takes a parameter argument and one that takes optional arguments?
- the difference is that optional can take any number of arguments.

7. How do you deﬁne a method that takes diﬀerent (and arbitrary) types of arguments?
- public static void methodname params_object[] name
